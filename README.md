# InvoiceGUI

### Summary
InvoiceGUI was my attempt at building my first python GUI. InvoiceGUI is a 
visual invoice generator. The idea was inspired from the invoices I had to submit at work which 
were tedious to put together. The project was fruitful in the sense that it allowed me to gain experience building a GUI, practice my
python skills and build something of use. In the end, the GUI itself lacks features common to most user friendly applications in the market 
and it is not the most aesthetically pleasing application ever (lol). Nonetheless, it does accomplish the task promised and that is producing invoices
from user input. Another key aspect of the project or rather lacking aspect is the absense of a database. This was intentional since it allowed to proceed faster with the project and didn't seem fitting for a tool so small and basic. I couldn't imagine the real additions a databse would provide for the application as it stands. Though, the application was built with the MVC architecture in mind allowing anyone to extend the application by implementing additinal features and of course connecting it to a database.
